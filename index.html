             <p class="articleText">
                 By holding Meta Fox, you own something more significant than a hyped PFP. Each Meta Fox NFT acts as a unique access key to the Meta Foxonry services ecosystem.
             </p>
             <p class="articleText">
                 Every single Meta Fox NFT is stakable and upgradable. It's crucial since you'll be able to earn NEAR from your NFTs while holding them.

             <p class="articleText">
                 The main issue of the NEAR NFT market is the lack of liquidity caused by its youth. In simple words, liquidity means the ability of the community to buy something. Higher liquidity - higher floor prices, more sales, increased quality of the projects.
             </p>
             <p class="articleText">
                 So, our mission is to help the NEAR NFT ecosystem by increasing its liquidity. Every single service we're building is designed to boost the entire ecosystem and share its profits with holders.

                Thunder Fox is a service built on the idea of limit orders adapted to the NFT space. Limit orders are made for buying assets when the right conditions suitable for the buyer appear.

            <p class="articleText">
                What will ThunderFox do for the community and ecosystem? Well, it's quite simple. It will add lots of liquidity to the market and save you plenty of time. ThunderFox - Fastest diamond hand on NEAR.

            <p class="articleText">
                ThunderFox wouldnâ€™t spam with notifications and ask you to make a deal. All you need is to make an order with the criteria of the NFT you want, as it works directly with the marketplace and doesnâ€™t need your help. When the first NFT you need appears, ThunderFox will immediately make a deal, leaving others without a chance to take it!

            </p>
            <p class="articleText">
                Magister Foxes are the last level of Fox evolution. You'll need to burn 3 Wadget Foxes and some $MFOX tokens to get one. But don't hurry up to burn them by yourself! We'll have a special website for this.

                Staking is the only way to mint our functional token called $MFOX. We believe staking is an essential feature for any valuable collection because it'll allow holders to earn from their NFTs without selling them. Also, it has several utilities to keep supply and demand balanced. The elaborate tokenomics and the huge number of ways to use them guarantee its systematic growing and support the good level of income from staking.
